The painting "plancton" was made by Benjamin Elron in a process of collecting and creating small size collage which was transfer to a large size oil painting. I found facinated by animals and insects and collaborate them in my works. This painting was influenced also by the song of Lucio Dalla "come profundo e'il mare". Plancton is a sort of visual poetry that dipict the complexity of nature and our treatment of the surraounding. You can find it at Palazzo Ca' Zanardi!
